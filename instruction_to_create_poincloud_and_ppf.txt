this is the instruction to generate the pointcloud and point pair feature of the objects.
assume we object like cup called "cup.obj"
1. generate the point cloud of the cup by running
	pcl_mesh2pcd cup.obj cup.pcd -leaf_size 0.001
2. convert the pointcloud to ply format by running
	pcl_pcd2ply cup.pcd cup.ply
3. compute the normal of the point cloud by running
	mkdir result
	rosrun icra20_manipulation_pose computePPF cup.ply result
4. above command will generate point pair features as "resultppf" and the pointcloud with normal as model.py in the result directory,
to check how the normal looks like. Running
	pcl_ply2pcd model.ply model.pcd
	pcl_viewer model.pcd -normals 1
so you can see the normal.
5. change the name of resultppf to ppf_cup
